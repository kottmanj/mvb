# State Specfic Measurement Protocols (Prototype Implementation)
The repository is designed to run the general procedure and show some example data from: [arxiv:2504.03019](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03019)

The methods to rotate the integrals and extract the HCB Hamiltonian are defined in the file `measurements_utils.py`. The additional utils files are made to create the quantum circuit (for scenario 2).

Free geometries have been generated with [quanti-gin](https://github.com/nylser/quanti-gin) and circuits depictions are made with [qpic](https://github.com/qpic/qpic).

# installation
`pip install -e .`

# usage
